<br><br>Each Vendor is required to have 1 coordinator, so you will NOT be able to remove a Coordinator until you designate somebody else as the coordinator.
<br /><br />Each Vendor can not have more than 6 coordinators.
<br /><br />The Coordinators can choose to receive a notification from our office when a payment to them has been made.  It can be in the form of a Text or E-Mail.  If you choose the text message option, you will have to supply us with your Cell Phone Provider and Cell Phone Number.
<br /><br />The Coordinator can check the status of his/her user's account setting by looking at the bottom of the user's section: <b>Date Validated E-Mail Sent</b> tells you when the application mailed out the "Secure Enhanced Vendor Remittance Registration" E-Mail to the user.  The <b>Date E-Mail Validated</b> tells you when the user clicked on the embedded hyperlink within the E-Mail that validated their E-Mail.  The <b>Date Password Changed</b> tells you when the user changed his/her password.  All 3 fields must have a value before the user will be allowed to log into the Enhanced Vendor Application. 
<br /><br />If you have any questions or concerns, please contact our office at <cfoutput><a href="Mailto:#application.VendorRemitEmail#?Subject=Secure Enhanced Vendor Remittance Registration">#application.VendorRemitEmail#</a> or contact our office at #application.VendorRemitPhone#</cfoutput>.</div>
