<tr><td colspan="2">Remember: All fields are required!<br><br>Click on the <input type="submit" name="Add" value="Register Me!" alt="Register Me!"> to complete the registration.  Once the Illinois Office of the Comptroller has verified your information, a "Secure Enhanced Vendor Remittance Registration" E-Mail from our office will be sent out to each of the Coordinator.  This usually takes 24 hours.  The Coordinator will need to click on the "Verify E-Mail Address" hyperlink within the E-Mail in order to continue on with the registration process.  <!---The user will then receive a "Secure Enhanced Vendor Remittance Change Password" E-Mail from the Comptroller's Office.  The user must click on the "Create Password" hyperlink to finish setting up his/her account.--->

<b><u>Data Entry Form</u></b>

<br /><br /></br>Only Vendor Coordinator's can be automatically registered via this form.  Once a Vendor Coordinator has completed his/her registration, the Coordinator can setup additional users for his/her Vendor through the Enhanced Vendor "Manager User" option that is given to the user once he/she has logged into the application. 
<br /><br />Each Vendor can not have more than 6 Coordinators.  If we determine that your Vendor already has 6 Coordinators, your access request will be denied.  If your Vendor has already had a Coordinator approved, please have him/her setup you up with access to this applicaiton instead of using this form.
<br /><br />The Coordinators can choose to receive a notification from our office when a payment to them has been made.  It can be in the form of a Text or E-Mail.  If you choose the text message option, you will have to supply us with your Cell Phone Provider and Cell Phone Number.
<br /><br />Once you have been approved as a Coordinator for your Vendor and have successfully setup your account, go into the "Manager Users" option once you are logged into the application to setup your payment notification information.
<br /><br /><br><br>If you have any questions or concerns, please contact our office at <cfoutput><a href="Mailto:#application.VendorRemitEmail#?Subject=Secure Enhanced Vendor Remittance Registration">#application.VendorRemitEmail#</a> or contact our office at #application.VendorRemitPhone#</cfoutput>.</b></td></tr>
