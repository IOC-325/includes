<h3>Download Help</h3>

<p>This process downloads the warrants you specify to an XML document with an Excel (xls) extension. The latest few versions of Excel will read the file, but you will receive a popup message that will tell you that the file is in a different format that is specified in the file extension. Simply click "Yes" to open the file, and it will open your data as an Excel spreadsheet.</p>

<!---<p><b>Advanced Options</b>
<br>By selecting the Download button from the List of Vendor Warrants, you get a file listing the columns you see in the vendor warrant listing page. If you select the Advanced Options hyperlink, however, you can also choose to get a description of what each warrant is for, as well as Accounting Line Details. Please note that downloading these additional fields will take extra time, particularly if you are downloading a lot of warrants.</p>
