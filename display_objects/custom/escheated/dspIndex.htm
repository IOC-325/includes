<p>Every year, thousands of state checks payable to taxpayers go uncashed. This page will allow taxpayers to learn whether they are owed uncashed state checks that are $5 or more, and that are between one and five years old. If an uncashed check (also called an escheated warrant) is located, the check replacement process also can be started here. There currently exist more than 100,000 such uncashed checks totaling more than $30 million.</p>

<p><strong><u>Important: Please read the following</u></strong></p>  

<p>Only the person legally entitled to the original warrant, or their heirs
or legal representatives, or a third party to whom it was properly
negotiated or the heirs or legal representatives of such party, may
request a replacement warrant.  In the case of a warrant issued to a
payee who dies before the warrant is paid by the State Treasurer and
whose estate has been probated pursuant to law, the Comptroller, upon
receipt of a certified copy of a judicial order establishing the person
or entity entitled to payment, may issue a replacement warrant to such
person or entity.</p>

<p>State law prohibits the replacement of a warrant outstanding for more than five years beyond its issue date (15 ILCS 405/10.10(a)).</p>

<p>Each replacement warrant is subject to the involuntary withholding provisions established at 15 ILCS 405/10.05.</p>
